# CONTROLLING A STEPPER MOTOR WITH ARDUINO

## Introduction

- A stepper motor is a type of a brushless DC motor that divides a full rotation in equal steps.
- Both the stepper motor and arduino controll the speed and direction .

## coomponents required

- 28BYJ- 48 Stepper motor
- ULN2003 motor Driver
- Arduino board (uno,mega )
- Jumper wires
- Power supply 5v DC
-

## Wiring Diagram

 ULN2003                 Arduino pins
 IN1                     PIN8
 IN2                     PIN9
 IN3                     PIN10
 IN4                     PIN11
 VCC                     5V
 GND                     GND

- The 28BYJ-48 stepper motor is connected to ULN2003 motor driver via an onboard white 5-pin connector.

## ARDUINO CODE

# include <Stepper.h>
`
# define STEPS 2048 // Steps per revolution for 28BYJ-48

Stepper myStepper(STEPS, 8, 10, 9, 11);

void setup() {
    myStepper.setSpeed(10); // Speed in RPM
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    Serial.println("Rotating clockwise");
    myStepper.step(STEPS); // Full rotation
    delay(1000);

    Serial.println("Rotating counterclockwise");
    myStepper.step(-STEPS); // Full rotation in opposite direction
    delay(1000);
}

## Breakdown

- The Stepper library is included to handle stepper motor movement.
- The Stepper object is initialized with the number of steps per revolution and the control pins.
- The setSpeed() function sets the rotation speed in RPM.
- The step() function is used to move the motor forward and backward in steps.

## Root Cause Analysis

- If the motor vibrates but does not rotate, check the wiring.
- Ensure the correct sequence of motor driver inputs.
- Adjust the speed settings if the motor does not move smoothly.
- Make sure the motor is receiving sufficient power.

## Conclusion

- Using an Arduino with a ULN2003 driver makes it simple to control a stepper motor for precise movements.
