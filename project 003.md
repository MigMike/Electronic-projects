# ULN2003 Motor Driver 

## Overview
The **ULN2003** is a high-voltage, high-current Darlington transistor array commonly used for driving stepper motors, relays, and other inductive loads. It consists of **seven NPN Darlington pairs**, each capable of driving **500mA** and withstanding peak currents up to **600mA**.

## Features
- 7-channel Darlington transistor array
- Each channel can handle **50V** and **500mA** continuous current
- Built-in **freewheeling diodes** for inductive load protection
- **TTL/CMOS compatible inputs**
- Commonly used to drive **28BYJ-48 stepper motors**
